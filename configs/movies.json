Having dispatched several of her arch-enemies in the first film, The Bride (Uma Thurman) continues in Kill Bill Vol. 2 on her deadly pursuit of her former partners in the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad, who, in a furious assault, attempted to murder her and her unborn child on her wedding day. As The Bride faces off against allies-turned-nemeses Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), she flashes back to the day of her deadly wedding, and we learn of how she was recruited to join the DiVAS, her training under unforgiving martial arts master Pai Mei (Liu Chia-hui), and her relationship with Squad leader Bill (David Carradine), which changed from love to violent hatred. Originally planned as a single film, Kill Bill grew into an epic-scale two-part project totaling more than four hours in length; as with the first film, Kill Bill Vol. 2 includes appearances by genre-film icons Sonny Chiba, Michael Parks, Larry Bishop, and Sid Haig; Wu-Tang Clan producer and turntablist RZA and filmmaker and composer Robert Rodriguez both contributed to the musical score.

Archer's single-minded pursuit of Troy has caused serious harm to his marriage, but Archer thinks the light may have appeared at the end of the tunnel when a seriously wounded Troy is captured in a bloody shootout.

First off, it was one of the first big hits for director Chang Cheh and set the tone for the many kung-fu hits he would later direct. One Armed Swordsman remains a stunningly well-crafted piece of work thanks to his inspired direction: Cheh keeps the complexly plotted tale moving forward at a skillfully modulated pace, and in the process, delivers a collection of stunning action scenes that grow ever more complex in choreography and length. One Armed Swordsman is also notable for kick-starting the career of star Jimmy Wang Yu. As the film's resourceful hero, Wang Yu exhibits the right combination of acting chops and machismo to create a protagonist who is just as compelling in the dramatic scenes as he is in the action sequences. The combination of a director and a star both delivering top-flight work helps make One Armed Swordsman a classic of its genre: its stylized look gives it the the feel of an adult fairy tale brought to life, Wang Yu's performance keeps the viewer emotionally invested in the film's unusual plot, and the sharply choreographed swordplay and martial arts scenes remain as exciting as ever. In short, One Armed Swordsman is well worth a look for anyone interested in classic kung-fu cinema and a must for students of the form.

Its success is rather remarkable considering its troubled production. Young martial arts star Alexander Fu-Sheng -- who plays the sixth son of the Yang family -- died tragically in the middle of production, causing a hasty rewrite which shifted the film's heroics to the fifth son (Gordon Lau). The flow of the story doesn't suffer much, if at all, but it tends to veer from accepted legend as it tells the supposedly true story of a Sung dynasty-era massacre perpetrated on the Yang family by General Pan Mai (Ku Ming) and his Mongol allies which leaves only two of the large family's males alive. The sixth son manages to get home to tell the horrifying tale, but has been driven mad by his experiences (the plot device used to write out Fu Sheng). The fifth son has been aimlessly traveling the countryside, where he has another encounter with General Pan's troops and barely escapes with his life. Hungry for revenge, he decides to wait and become a Buddhist monk at the Ching Ling Temple in the meantime. As might be expected, his burning fury and lust for blood don't sit very well with Buddhist philosophy, and he is quickly asked to leave the temple. Yang number five is not so willing to do so, and promptly shaves his head and insists that he is staying, much to the monks' chagrin.

Since the apocalypse, the lengthy, desolate stretches of highway in the Australian outback have become bloodstained battlegrounds. Max has seen too many innocents and fellow officers murdered by the bomb's savage offspring, bestial marauding bikers for whom killing, rape, and looting is a way of life. He just wants to retire and spend time with his wife and son but lets his boss talk him into taking a peaceful vacation and he starts to reconsider. Then his world is shattered as a gang led by the evil Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne) murders his family in retaliation for the death of one of its members. Dead inside, Max straps on his helmet and climbs into a souped-up V8 racing machine to seek his bloody revenge. Despite an obviously low budget and a plot reminiscent of many spaghetti Westerns, Mad Max is tremendously exciting, thanks to some of the most spectacular road stunts ever put on film. Cinematographer David Eggby and stunt coordinator Grant Page did some of their best work under Miller's direction and crafted a gritty, gripping thrill ride which spawned two sequels, numerous imitations, and made Mel Gibson an international star. One sequence, in which a man is chained to a car and must cut off a limb before the machine explodes is one of the most tense scenes of the decade. The American version dubbed all the voices -- including Gibson's -- in a particularly cartoonish manner. Trivia buffs should note that Max's car is a 1973 Ford Falcon GT Coupe with a 300 bhp 351C V8 engine, customized with the front end of a Ford Fairmont and other modifications.

He just wants to retire and spend time with his wife and son but lets his boss talk him into taking a peaceful vacation and he starts to reconsider. Then his world is shattered as a gang led by the evil Toecutter (<a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/hugh-keays-byrne-p37287\" class=\"name-link\">Hugh Keays-Byrne</a>) murders his family in retaliation for the death of one of its members. Dead inside, Max straps on his helmet and climbs into a souped-up V8 racing machine to seek his bloody revenge. Despite an obviously low budget and a plot reminiscent of many spaghetti Westerns, <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/movie/mad-max-v30657\" class=\"movie-link\">Mad Max</a> is tremendously exciting, thanks to some of the most spectacular road stunts ever put on film. Cinematographer <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/david-eggby-p88729\" class=\"name-link\">David Eggby</a> and stunt coordinator <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/grant-page-p105365\" class=\"name-link\">Grant Page</a> did some of their best work under <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/miller-p206572\" class=\"name-link\">Miller</a>'s direction and crafted a gritty, gripping thrill ride which spawned two sequels, numerous imitations, and made <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/mel-gibson-p91479\" class=\"name-link\">Mel Gibson</a> an international star. One sequence, in which a man is chained to a car and must cut off a limb before the machine explodes is one of the most tense scenes of the decade. The American version dubbed all the voices -- including <a href=\"https://www.allmovie.com/artist/gibson-p91479\" class=\"name-link\">Gibson</a>'s -- in a particularly cartoonish manner. Trivia buffs should note that Max's car is a 1973 Ford Falcon GT Coupe with a 300 bhp 351C V8 engine, customized with the front end of a Ford Fairmont and other modifications.        </div>", "produced_by": "na", "directed_by": "George Miller"},
